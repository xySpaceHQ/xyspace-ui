// maplibre-gl ships its web worker as two ESM files (maplibre-gl-worker.mjs
// importing maplibre-gl-shared.mjs) and locates them at runtime via a URL
// relative to its own bundled location. Bundlers can't statically detect
// that lookup, so the worker never gets copied into a build automatically.
//
// We vendor a *self-contained* bundle of the worker (its internal import
// inlined) next to map.tsx (for Storybook/dev, via prepare) and next to
// the built dist/ entry points (via postbuild), so
// `new URL("./maplibre-gl-worker.mjs", import.meta.url)` resolves correctly
// in both contexts. Bundling it into one file — rather than vendoring both
// files as-is — matters because most bundlers' `new URL(relative,
// import.meta.url)` asset handling copies the referenced file verbatim
// without processing imports inside it; a single file with nothing left to
// resolve sidesteps that entirely.
